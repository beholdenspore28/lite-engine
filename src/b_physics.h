/* Newton's Laws of Motion:
Law I
A body tends to remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at constant
velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This is the so-called concept of
inertia.

Law II F = m * a = F = (M) (Length/Time2
Force is mass times acceleration which is itself equal to mass times length over time squared
The acceleration of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on the body,
and this acceleration is in the same direction as the resultant force.

Law III
For every force acting on a body (action) there is an equal and opposite reacting
force (reaction), where the reaction is collinear to the acting force.
